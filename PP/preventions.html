    <h5>
        STEM, but computer programming in particular, is very self-sustaining and independent. These characteristics can be used to an individualâ€™s advantage. There are numerous sources of information surrounding this topic that provide relevant and 
        useful information, such as free online courses (depicted under the <a href="file:///Users/mlovan/Desktop/PP/resources.html">Resources</a> tab). This path could demonstrate challenging since it is quite necessary to obtain a device that is able 
        to connect to the internet. An alternative to this is visiting public places that provide computers or devices that access the internet or joining local clubs that explore these ideas.

    <h5>
        Some of the most damaging aspects to a woman's journey into STEM is the criticism and stereotypes she gets put on to them. These instances could be thought of to be as small as internalized sicrimination because it leads to an outer expression. 
        This not only discourages the increase of female participation in STEM but also creates a dangerous working and living environment for the individual. A possible method of combatting this issue is by stopping and informing those around you whenever
        any negative gender based comment is stated. In addition, you can continue to educate yourself by listening to people who have experienced this first hand and evaluate the way you approach certain circumstanses while keeping their feelings in mind.

    <h5>
       In many circumstances, it is best to concrete information into people at a very young age, and this is one of them. Throughout my earlier ages I remember STEM being heavily connected to the male population while women were more influenced into 
       child care occupations and hobbies. As this expands and continues, the female STEM population gets cut off at the root and is given limited oppertunities to grow. I personally believe that if measures were taken to furhter persuade me into STEM 
       at a young age I would have found one of my passions and interests. In other cases the lack of inclusion during the early stages completely stunts a female childs interests in expanding their knowledge of this topic. This can be easily combatted
       by including and encouraging <u><b>everyone</b></u> in STEM activities, clubs, and discussions.
